            Hey Jeenal Sharma (JS),
            <br><br>
            I know life has taken us in different directions, but that doesn‚Äôt change how much our friendship meant to me. 
            Every laugh, every inside joke, and every late-night conversation is a memory I‚Äôll always treasure. You were never just my best friend‚Äîyou were and are a part of my family. 
            No matter what, you‚Äôll always have a greatest place in my heart. 
            <br><br>
           If this Made you smile then say hi, Anandiii - See it as a Chotu sa effort to make you happy. üíô
            <br><br>
            Suuuurrrrryyy if i ever hurted you or said something over limit - Don't you think you looks like Radha Rani üí´
